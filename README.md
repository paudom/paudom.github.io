# Pablo Domingo
I am a second-year Ph.D. student (since 2022) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), under the supervision of Prof. Javier Ruiz Hidalgo. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with a particular interest in generative AI. Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master’s Thesis at UPC in 2021, where I worked on conditioning GANs to generate realistic indoor images based on room structures. In 2020, I co-founded StageInHome, where I served as an AI Engineer and developed the methods powering its automatic decorator. Currently, I am a Senior AI Engineer at Napptilus Tech Labs, where I apply cutting-edge AI technologies to solve complex challenges.
